## Keypoints Detection Using ORB

**ORB** stands for **Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF**.This algorithm came out of the OpenCV Labs. It's fast, robust, and open
source.There are few algorithms like **SIFT** and **SURF** which are also doing the similar tasks,but both are computationally expensive
and patented, so you can't use them for commercial purposes, this is why ORB is good in many ways.
